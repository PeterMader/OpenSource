## What is Proprietary Software?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proprietary software is any software which is copyrighted by a company or
 individual and does not release its <abbr title=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

'Source code' is the programming code written by programmers that can be
 converted into executable files, like .exe files in Windows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

>source code</abbr> under a <abbr title=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Permissive licenses allow you to do what you wish with the software or source
 code.
 Well known licenses include the GNU GPL and the MIT licenses.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

>permissive license.</abbr> Some examples of proprietary software include
 Microsoft Windows, Photoshop, Facebook, and Google Chrome.
 Proprietary software is usually sold for profit (like Photoshop), released
 as a free (as in money) service in exchange for user information (like
 Google), or sold and used for information harvesting (like Microsoft Windows.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst there is a wealth of ethically developed proprietary software, many
 of the most commonly known large software companies (like Google, Facebook,
 and Microsoft) are extremely exploitative and take advantage of their users
 through information harvesting, extremely high prices and intrusive targeted
 advertising.
 There are many dangers to this kind of proprietary software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
## The Cost of Proprietary Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most people can only name one or two search engines, image editors, operating
 systems, word processors, web browsers, and only a small handful of social
 media networks.
 Once you've made software, you can just copy it as many times as you want.
 This means you can easily make a monopoly in a software market.
 This is excellent for the pockets of technology company executives, but
 not good for consumers and entrepreneurs.
 Because there aren't any companies to compete with, companies can jack
 up the prices for their software to whatever prices they wish, and consumers
 can do very little about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of Microsoft Windows, very few users know of any alternatives
 other than macOS, which is often dismissed as too expensive, so Microsoft
 can do whatever they want to their customers.
 Recently, Microsoft started adding targeted advertisements to the Start
 Menu of their already costly operating system, charging monthly subscription
 fees to remove ads from Microsoft Solitaire and Minesweeper,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and now have irremovable snooping tools that send Microsoft details about
 everything from your computer hardware to the amount of photos you have
 viewed in their 'Photos' application in the past day.
 In one report, a Windows 10 installation configured to transmit as little
 data as possible to Microsoft sent 5500 messages to Microsoft owned servers
 in a single day
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1,key-2"

\end_inset

.
 Also, as you can no longer disable forced updates, so you are totally at
 the mercy of whatever Microsoft throws at you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As well as Windows, the various services Google offers spy on users to an
 unacceptable degree.
 **
\series bold
Google stores every search you ever make, the link to every website you
 ever visit in Google Chrome; and in other browsers, browsing history and
 analytics from millions of websites.
\series default
** Google Analytics, a 'free' service that aggregagtes various statistics
 such as page views, location heatmaps, 
\emph on
*and even aggressive gender and age predictions*
\emph default
 for every user, has its code embedded in millions of major websites, meaning
 that even without a Google account, using a browser other than Google Chrome,
 Google can still generate a comprehensive list of websites you visit and
 create targeted advertisements based on them.
 Google has even taken it to the next level, and created entire operating
 systems, ChromeOS and Android, that have spyware integrated into the operating
 systems themselves.
 It has gotten to the point where using Google products is mandatory for
 use in classrooms Don't be mistaken - Google is an advertising company,
 not a search engine, not a cloud service provider, not an operating system
 developer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some software, like Photoshop, isn't renowned for spying or targeted advertising
, but rather comes with a massive up-front cost.
 Adobe Photoshop costs $240 per year
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-12"

\end_inset

 (in USD) for a license, and Microsoft's Visual Studio (code editor) costs
 $539, also per year.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-11"

\end_inset

 This locks out a massive market of users, like students and people in the
 third world who can't afford these software pacakges.
 Also, because of patent law surrounding software, companies can patent
 broad concepts and create a monopoly that cannot legally be broken.
 This leads to software like Adobe Photoshop being classed as 'industry
 standards' which raise the bar even higher for many potential users, as
 they can't get a job without a license and extensive knowledge of the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
## What Can I Do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best thing you can do to stop companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook
 from becoming even worse than they already are is to stop using their products,
 and transition to using free and open source software.
 This comes with a myriad of benefits, including not being subjected to
 the unethical pratices of major software corporations, and saving a significant
 amount of time and money, with the added bonus of equally good software.

\begin_layout Section*
# Open Source Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
## What is Open Source Software?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Source means that the source code of a software package is publicly
 available and free for anyone to use.
 Some well known examples of open source software include Firefox, VLC,
 Linux, and MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia.
 When people talk about open source software, or free software, they are
 usually talking about Free and Open Source Software (abbreviated as FOSS.)
 The term 'Free Software' is something of a misnomer, as it is free as in
 freedom, not as in price (although it is almost always both.) This is why
 free software is so powerful; you as the user have freedom to use, modify,
 and distribute the software.
 Note that the terms "Free software", "FOSS" and "Open Source Software"
 are used interchangeably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
## Why use Open Source?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
**Open source software is essential as it respects the user.** Because anyone
 can view the source code, *anyone can audit free software* to ensure that
 proper security measures are taken and that no malicious code is present,
 and *many free software advocates do.* The GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems
 are 
\emph on
used *extensively by many major technology companies*
\emph default
 (including Microsoft
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

) for their servers, as they are extremely fast and secure.
 Because many more people view the source code than in proprietary software
 settings, *bugs and security flaws are found much more quickly, and often
 patched within hours.*
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
**Open source software is often much faster and supports many more platforms
 than proprietary software.** Because anybody can contribute to free software
 projects, *anyone can optimise and improve software to make it run on older
 hardware, or even different operating systems.* Porting software to another
 operating system often requires minimal effort, and anyone who wishes to
 extend support for free software to their platform can easily do so; where
 they otherwise might have to open a support ticket for proprietary software
 and get a response along the lines of their feature request being denied
 due to lack of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
**Open source software does not spy on you.** With the rise of advertising
 companies like Google, privacy can be a massive concern.
 Google's Chrome browser sends browsing history and usage statistics to
 Google, and uses that data for targeted advertising.
 Not only is this exploiting users, but if the security of a firm like Google
 were compromised, everyone's data would be compromised too.
 Additionally, because data-aggregation firms do not release the source
 code or even details of their security mechanisms, you can never be sure
 who to trust.
 *Over 5 billion online accounts are known to have been compromised because
 of poor security practices in proprietary software.*
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
## Common Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
**Why do people create free software?** There are many reasons for creating
 free software.
 Many programmers, myself included, enjoy programming.
 Some people write and maintain free software projects for professional
 reasons.
 Some people write free software because they are fed up with the inadequacies
 of outdated or poorly designed proprietary software.
 Some write free software to give back to the community.
 As Richard Stallman (creator of the Free Software Foundation and GNU) says,

 they have no hope of making a living that way.

\end_inset

 A great article on the motives of writing free software is available [here](htt
ps://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fs-motives.html)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
**How can free software developed as a hobby rival proprietary software?**
 In addition to professional and amateur programmers working on free software
 in their spare time, many people are sponsored or paid full time to write
 free software by corporations in need of better software.
 Some, like the maintainers of the Linux Mint operating system, receive
 enough donations to live off.
 The Red Hat Linux operating system is FOSS and commercial at the same time,
 as they make money from tech support.
 Even if only 1 in 100 000 people write free software as a hobby, that's
 76 000 people.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

 The amount of people who are able to benefit from free software is massive;
 and often companies will sponsor free software projects that they depend
 on for their products and services to function.
 For example, the developer of (Tiled)[http://www.mapeditor.org/], a FOSS
 map editor for video game development, receives almost $2000 a month from
 donations,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 enough to fund two working days a week development for it.
